# 🧮 Python Calculator

This project is a **simple command-line calculator** that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It allows users to continuously perform calculations using the previous result or start a new calculation.

## 🚀 Features

- Supports **addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)**
- Allows **chained calculations** with previous results
- Provides an option to **start a new calculation**
- Uses a **dictionary-based function mapping** for operations
- Implements **recursive calls** to restart the calculator when needed

## 🔧 How to Use

1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter the first number.
3. Choose an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).
4. Enter the next number.
5. The result is displayed.
6. Choose whether to continue calculating with the result (`y`) or start fresh (`n`).
7. If `n` is selected, the screen is cleared and a new calculation starts.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Replit** – `clear()` function for screen clearing (replace with OS-specific commands if needed)

## 📌 Example Usage

```
+
+
-
*
/
Pick an operation: +
What's the next number?: 5
10 + 5 = 15
Type 'y' to continue calculating with 15, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: y
Pick an operation: *
What's the next number?: 2
15 * 2 = 30
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Add **exponentiation (`^`) and modulus (`%`) operations**
- Implement **error handling** for division by zero
- Create a **GUI version** using Tkinter or PyQt
- Allow **input of complex expressions**
